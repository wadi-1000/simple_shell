**# 0x16. C - Simple Shell**

### A simple shell project.

**### Tasks**

0.  Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks.

1.  Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

	* Your shell should:
		- Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.

		- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.

		- The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.

		- The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.

		- If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.

		- Handle errors.

		- You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)

2. Handle command lines with arguments.

3. Handle the PATH
	- fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist.

4. Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell.
	- Usage: exit
	- You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit

5. Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment.
